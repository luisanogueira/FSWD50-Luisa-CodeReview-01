		<p class="aboutme">I work independently as a copywriter and marketing manager. 
		However, I started learning front-end development with some online classes and tutorials, and that is when I started to 
		enjoy learning and practicing HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I used the knowledge acquired in those online classes to build
		a website evaluating ICOs for a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stellar.org/">Stellar Build Challenge.</a></p>
		<p class="aboutme">Finally, I decided to take the step forward and subscribed to the Front-End Development Course at
		CodeFactory, in Vienna, where I moved to just a few weeks ago. I am learning a lot from this practical experience and
		want to continue practicing and developing my skills, hopefully commiting many mistakes and finding solutions for problems that I will encounter along the way. After I develop those skills, I want to subscribe to the Back-End Development Course and integrate my previous knowledge with this new experience.</p>
