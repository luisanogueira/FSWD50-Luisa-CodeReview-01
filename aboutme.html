      <p class="aboutme">
        I work independently as a copywriter and marketing manager. However, I
        started learning front-end development with some online classes and
        tutorials, and that is when I started to enjoy learning and practicing
        HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I used the knowledge acquired in those
        online classes to build a website evaluating ICOs for a
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stellar.org/"
          >Stellar Build Challenge.</a
        >
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        Finally, I decided to take the step forward and subscribed to the
        Front-End Development Course at CodeFactory, in Vienna, where I moved to
        just a few weeks ago. I am learning a lot from this practical experience
        and want to continue practicing and developing my skills, hopefully
        commiting many mistakes and finding solutions for problems that I will
        encounter along the way. After I develop those skills, I want to
        subscribe to the Back-End Development Course and integrate my previous
        knowledge with this new experience.
